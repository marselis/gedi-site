# Gedi Website
This is the initial repository for the GEDI site, hosted on GitHub pages. Feel free to clone it and move it somewhere else.

### Notes
There are two config files, one named `_config.yml` and the other `_config_dev.yml`. `_config_dev.yml` contains the proper settings for viewing the project locally, while `_config.yml` contains the settings for GitHub Pages. Run the command `jekyll serve --config _config_dev.yml` to view locally.
